Hold yourself accountable for what you said you'd complete today. Each day is given an entry, and you have 24 hours to complete your todo list ‚è∞. When you miss a day, you'll skip an entry, which means you'll have one less opportunity to complete your tasks. This feature encourages you to stay on track and not let your daily tasks fall behind.
