              Hold yourself accountable for what you said you'd complete today.
              Each day is given an entry, and you have 24 hours to complete your
              todo list ‚è∞. When you miss a day, you'll skip an entry, which
              means you'll have one less opportunity to complete your tasks.
              This feature encourages you to stay on track and not let your
              daily tasks fall behind.
